# Terms

Terms is a tiling terminal emulator for GNOME, built using Rust and GTK4.

## Status

It probably won't burn down your house.

## Why

Why another terminal? Good question. There's really no good argument for using
Terms over any other terminal. I hope there will be, some day.

## Install

Although I would not recommend Terms to be your daily driver yet, it has reached a
certain level of usability.

You can install it by installing setting up the [repository](./io.github.vhdirk.Terms.flatpakrepo):

```sh
flatpak remote-add --user io.github.vhdirk.terms https://vhdirk.github.io/terms/io.github.vhdirk.Terms.flatpakrepo
```

Then, you can install Terms itself:

```sh
flatpak install --user  io.github.vhdirk.Terms
```

You can also download the [latest build](https://nightly.link/vhdirk/terms/workflows/docs/main/io.github.vhdirk.Terms-x86_64.zip).
